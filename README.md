# Python logging module exploration

I'm exploring the Python logging module, specifically using YAML configuration. Configuration files nicely remove unnecessary logic from an application's main logic, but are not documented in the clearest way. This repository represents my efforts to experiment with the dictConfig aspect of logging to see how easy logging will be to integrate with systems I build.
